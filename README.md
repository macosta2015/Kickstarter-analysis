# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. We are practicing data analysis. 


## Kickstarting with Excel RESULTS
## FEEDBACK

### Overview of Project
The project brought the fundamentals for data analysis.

#### Purpose
This introduction are the bases for further data analysis training. 

### Analysis and Challenges
Several challenges when building graphs that have plenty of data with them. My computer went really slow. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data shows us the success rate. It would be smart to launch a theater campaign   during summer time. Specially in June

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the data, the greater the needed money, the higher failure rate. It is possible to see that the campaigns with the less needed money, has a higher success rate. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For some reason some of my graphs debiated from the graphs shown in the example. Mostly the reason is provably because the data was taken wrong at the beginning.

### Results
The data is important, though it does not have value until it is processed and changed into information. 
With data visualization, it is possible to have a better look at the graphs, tables, etc. The real value is that a person is easily able to understand the information.
